# University Selection System Using SQL
Accessible university selection system is vital for a student's college selection process as it
is in a limited time frame and has multiple options to select from. With millions of students
from around the globe applying to a few elite universities, students find it hard to
understand what’s the actual location, what courses are offered and placements of
university. To make things easy and provide a solution, I thought and designed a University
Selection System using SQL.

### The system project showcases how structured data storage and Sql queries can be used to:

i. Find the suitable university from the available options.

ii. Track educational performance of different countries.

iii. Calculate the ROI (Return on Investment) for students.

### The system consist of multiple tables:

A. University: The name and establishment year of Universities.

B. QS Ranking: The global university rank by QS.

C. Location: The address of university.

D. Fees: The lowest and highest as well as average fees of each university.

E. Placement: The placement percentage by each university.

F. Courses: The availability of courses offered by each university.

By the use of SQL Functions, Joins, Grouping and Filtering, the system project simulates
the real world selection process between options of universities and shows how students
and education guidance businesses can make data driven decisions.
